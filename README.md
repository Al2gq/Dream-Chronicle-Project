Repository for final project Dream Chronicler

Current Progress: The basic framework for the app's storyboard is fully completed, so far as I am aware. Transitions work correctly for I have completed the music player meant to play continually while the user is asleep, and added functionality to make it start and stop with a shake. The drawing functionality meant to allow users to depict some portion of their dreams and append them to a specific entry is almost complete, but the code has not yet been fully implemented. My most pressing current issue is implementing Firebase. I have made progress on doing so, and created an app on the Firebase website, but have not yet implemented any code for saving things to it. However, once this code is written, it should be possible to save profiles, dreams, art, and audio, implementing the primary functions of the app.
